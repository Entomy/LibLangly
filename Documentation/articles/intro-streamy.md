# Streamy

**Streamy** is something I never wanted to happen, but my hand was forced. When developing **Stringier**'s patterns framework and parsing engine, it was originally designed to parse in memory buffers, by far the most common situation. I realized later that the approach could easily be adapted to parse most streams, as long as some basic conditions were met. This would greatly improve performance when parsing large files on disk, and because of how streams are abstract, would open the door to possibilities like parsing a text stream sent over the network. Trying to use .NET's Stream failed miserably, and as I investigated why, I uncovered numerous questionable or poorly thought out design decisions, and even security vulnerabilities the OWASP now recognizes and has practicies to protect against. It became clear: the stream needed an entire modern redesign.

**Streamy** tried to provide a similar experience to existing and familiar Stream APIs, but will not sacrifice security or usability, and so its experience is not entirely the same. Nevertheless, it should be easy to learn, and fully intends to provide the best possible Stream API of any implementation out there, across languages.

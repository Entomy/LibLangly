# Exceptions

**LibLangly** defines a _lot_ of exceptions. Look, we're all developers, we all have run into some god awful error messages. It _sucks_. The point here is to provide a very rich exception hierarchy allowing for handlers to be broad, but reporting to be detailed. Furthermore, because the exceptions get so specific, it means error messages can start to be generated by the framework. In all cases exception types provide some static variant of a `With()` function that takes the relevant parameters and generates the message for you. What was `throw new ArgumentException("hopefully someone fills this out in a detailed way", nameof(argument));` can now be `throw ExampleException.With(...relevant parameters);` You get a well defined and consistent error message for you!

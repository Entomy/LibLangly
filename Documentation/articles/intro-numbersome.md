# Numbersome

**Numbersome** was next, and mostly served as a way to relax while doing the frustrating work if data structure design. It provides common, simple, and often overlooked math operations and some auxillary types to help out. I deprecated this for over a year, but after **Philosoft** became a thing, it was reworked to support it. It's not particularly useful as a serious math library, but will support more basic and common scenarios. It mostly serves to extend collections made with **Philosoft**'s Trait and Concepts API, when those collections are of numeric types.

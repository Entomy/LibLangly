# Console Injection

There's a few things that always bugged me about console APIs. One of the biggest was the inability to debug. Why? Unlike other streams, a console stream is guaranteed to be entirely within the computer. Everything is _right there_. [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) seemed like the right answer. But how? [`Console`](https://entomy.github.io/LibLangly/api/Langly.Console.html) is a static class, not an instance where components could be injected.

Enter [`Console.Internals`](https://entomy.github.io/LibLangly/api/Langly.Console.Internals.html), a nested static class which contains the components that make the [`Console`](https://entomy.github.io/LibLangly/api/Langly.Console.html) work. Under normal operations everything is set up with reasonable defaults and you can completely ignore this. In fact, it shouldn't show up in most cases as [`EditorBrowsable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.editorbrowsableattribute) has been applied with `Advanced`. But it's there, and you can replace components. There's some useful stuff located in [`Langly.Internals`](https://entomy.github.io/LibLangly/api/Langly.Internals.html) for this purpose, like a debuggable console component that fully supports unit testing both reads and writes. Yes, you can unit test _synthesized human input_. The DI interfaces are located here as well, so if you wish to provide new functionality that isn't in this library, such is possible.

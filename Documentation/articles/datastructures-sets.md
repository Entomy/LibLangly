# Sets

Sets are a wonderfully powerful concept, but one that often isn't implemented right. **LibLangly**'s Set is strictly based on [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) and [Set Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets), allowing programmers to take advantage of an entire field of mathematics and all the problems they've already solved.

For more information, check out of the following articles: [ISet&lt;T&gt; considered harmful](https://dev.to/entomy/iset-t-considered-harmful-2hpd) and [Proper Sets](https://dev.to/entomy/proper-sets-4p0b), which discuss the problems and solution respectively.

# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to understand an enforce that: this is a project, not a government; there will be a focus on the project, and an ignorance of individuals lives outside of this project scope, including but not limited to: their personal, professional, political, and sexual lives.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Focusing on the project
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Accepting debate over ideas/approaches/etc.

Examples of behavior that interferes with creating a positive environment include:

* Dragging parts of peoples lives outside of this project into this project, including but not limited to:
	* Their age, body size, disability or disorder or lack thereof, race, ethnicity, sex characteristics, identity and expression or lack thereof, formal education or lack thereof, personal appearance, religion or lack thereof, social activism or lack thereof, or criminal record or lack thereof.
	* Their actions outside of this project.
* Political discussions. This is not intended to stifle political speech. Rather, free speech of political ideas is actively protected. It is just asked that such discussions happen in a forum, chatroom, or similar, not directly in the project space. Any political discussion happening outside of the project space can not be held against a contributor.
* Sexual discussions, commentary, innuendos, etc.
* Publishing others confidential personal information; doxxing
* Essentially anything not directly related to this project

## Responsibilities and Enforcement

In this projects current state, I, Patrick Kelly (Entomy), am solely responsible for all matters. As this project grows, I hope to change this, as things are more fair when there's alternative ideas and viewpoints.

## Protections

All contributors and maintainers are to be warned, with detailed explanation and citation of their CoC violation, and be asked to correct it, before corrective or disciplinary action is made against them, excluding cases of generally illegal activity. This exception is intended to cover situations such as hacking into another contributor or maintainers device, assault or battery against another contributor or maintainer, etc. It is not intended to cover petty crime or misdemeanors unrelated to this project.

In the second case of a violation of the CoC, and all further violations therein, the offending individuals retention in the project shall be held to a vote among the project maintainers. Of this vote, a two-thirds or greater count in favor of removal is required for action. In instances where there are less than three maintainers, unanimous vote is required for action.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct only applies within the project space. That should be pretty obvious. If it's not to you, think long and hard about how and why this project would have any authority over others lives.

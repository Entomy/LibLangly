**Stringier.Functions** is a broad set of stand-alone text processing and manipulation functions for all kinds of purposes. While it's primary purpose is to provide orthogonality to the API's across text types, it also aims to do this in an efficient way, while integrating concepts from other parts of **Stringier**. Generally speaking, this is what most people are going to want to work directly with.

Everyone works with text. Let's make it better.

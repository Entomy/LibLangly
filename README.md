**LibLangly** is the combination of a collection of my projects that were originally in separate repos but were conceptually part of the same thing. Each component forms part of the standard library and runtime library of another language called **Langly**. However, rather unusually, this runtime is available to other consumers, such as C# or F#. In fact, if you've been using any of these component libraries already, you were using another languages runtime and didn't even know it! As this project grew and became more fleshed out, it became apparent everything needed to be merged into a single monorepo, with better coordination.

**LibLangly** is the combination of a collection of my projects that were originally in separate repos but were conceptually part of the same thing. Each component forms part of the standard library and runtime library of another language called **Langly**. However, rather unusually, this runtime is available to other consumers, such as C# or F#. In fact, if you've been using any of these component libraries already, you were using another languages runtime and didn't even know it! As this project grew and became more fleshed out, it became apparent everything needed to be merged into a single monorepo, with better coordination.

So, if **LibLangly** is meant as a language runtime, why use it without that language? **Langly** is still in development, and even then, is only meant as a DSL for working with language. It's targeting .NET for its [CLS Compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components), allowing other full languages like C# or F# to do other work. _Use the best tool for the job_. Sometimes, creating an entire **Langly** project would be overkill. Sometimes, you just need to do a little text manipulation inside of an existing project. Sometimes, you may be interested in the internals that makes **LibLangly** work, like the [traits API](https://entomy.github.io/LibLangly/articles/traits.html). Sometimes, you may be interested in just the uniquely designed data structures library, **Collectathon**, because it offers something you need. Because you can consume this library from other .NET languages, you can still make use of everything here, just as you would any other library. All **Langly** is really meant for is exposing this library through a DSL that makes it easier to work with when you're doing some _heavy_ text work.

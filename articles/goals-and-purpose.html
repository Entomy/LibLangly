<h1 id="goals--purpose">Goals &amp; Purpose</h1>

<p>This document exists to elaborate on the goals and purpose of this project. Matters are listed in order of priority, from highest to lowest. This document should be treated as a perscriptive design.</p>
<p>This document will not use overloaded or vague buzzwords, such as &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;, as these words are so overused that they mean drastically different and unrelated things between people. Instead, specific words with detailed explainations are used. If you do not beleive something is clear enough, that should be treated as an <a href="https://github.com/Entomy/LibLangly/issues/new/">issue</a>, so request clarification.</p>
<h1 id="1-usability">1) Usability</h1>
<p>First and foremost, this project exists to be highly usable. People do not use things that are difficult to use. People do not encourage others to use things that are difficult to use. High usability is acheived through several means, all equally as important.</p>
<h3 id="good-documentation">Good documentation</h3>
<p>Everything must be documented, both external and internal API's. This project makes use of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/docfx">docfx</a> to provide a documentation website. As such, providing good documentation is just a matter of maintaining doc-comments and a few articles. These doc-comments describe the API and intended behavior. Any deviation of the code is likely an error, but file an <a href="https://github.com/Entomy/LibLangly/issues/new/">issue</a> so the matter can be looked into.</p>
<p>This project uses a custom <code>Global.ruleset</code> to enforce this requirement, and any public API must be documented in order for builds to succeed.</p>
<h3 id="consistent-api">Consistent API</h3>
<p>The API should behave as consistently as possible. This means orthagonality is a high priority, but not necessarily absolute orthagonality.</p>
<p>To help with this goal <strong>Philosoft</strong> was developed. The whole subproject codifies various design patterns and architectural decisions to enforce a consistent API, right down to the metadata level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you've worked with alternative parsing engines, especially parser combinators, you may have encountered how drastically different the return types can be. This is not considered acceptable. Users should not have to memorize which parsers have which return type, nor change their code because of a change to their parser.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principal of Least Astonishment</a>; <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Krug, S. Don't Make Me Think</a></p>
<h3 id="clean-api">Clean API</h3>
<p>The API should be as clean as possible. This means that there should be as few calls as possible to do what is meant. <code>String(&quot;Hello&quot;).Then(String(&quot;World&quot;))</code> is rediculous; use extension methods to get <code>&quot;Hello&quot;.Then(&quot;World&quot;)</code>. The methods should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM">Do The Right Thing</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, it's important that methods don't do more than one thing. This can seem like conflicting goals, but the idea is for each method to represent &quot;one unit of work&quot;, whatever that might be.</p>
<p>As an example consider a simple collection. <code>AddAndSort()</code> does too much. Instead, it should be separated into two discrete methods, <code>Add()</code> and <code>Sort()</code>. However, <code>CreateNode()</code>, <code>SeekTo()</code>, and <code>LinkInto()</code> is excessive, when <code>Insert()</code> is the discrete unit of work.</p>
<h3 id="do-the-right-thing">Do The Right Thing</h3>
<p>Also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM">Do What I Mean</a>. This means that the API should strive to translate descriptions and intent, not literal commands, into executable action. This forms the basis of <a href="https://entomy.github.io/Stringier/articles/patterns-optimization.html">Self Optimization</a> that the parsing engine uses.</p>
<p>In absolutely no way should &quot;the right thing&quot; be taken as &quot;fixing mistakes&quot;. Any changes must have no change in actual behavior, just in execution. For example, there's no point in processing a double negation, as the outcome of no negation at all is exactly the same and executes faster. Mistakes are mistakes and need to be fixed by the programmer. Autocorrect is not &quot;the right thing&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="feels-right">Feels Right</h3>
<p>The API should &quot;feel right&quot; within the context of the language being used. This means a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.clscompliantattribute"><code>CLSCompliant</code></a> core with language specific bindings when necessary to provide that feeling. Programmers should not have to suddenly and radically change programming paradigms just to use a library; this is jarring and discouraging. However, by relying on a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.clscompliantattribute"><code>CLSCompliant</code></a> core, the same approach can be used across all languages if necessary, keeping the learning curve lower. Neither approach is forced, and this is actually very easy to maintain. In practice, C# and VisualBasic consumers can readily use the core, while F# needs some basic bindings to map object methods to pipelineable functions.</p>
<h2 id="2-correct">2) Correct</h2>
<p>Algorithms should be correct. While this might seem obvious, there are plenty of cases of optimizing certain cases and causing the resulting algorithm to be fast but incorrect. As an example, look at the amount of Palindrome checkers which mistakenly reverse a string and compare. While this is fast and efficient, it also only works for a subset of Palindromes. Even worse, there's a faster way that checks for the same subset. The appropriate implementation for this project is the algorithm which correctly identifies all Palindromes.</p>
<p>Make it work right, then make it fast.</p>
<p>Highly optimal but incomplete code tends to be very simple as well, so when those edge cases are the only thing being addressed, it's very easy for downstream to implement and use these. Similarly, if many existing libraries are providing incomplete algorithms, and this is what downstream needs, they are free to use those.</p>
<h2 id="3-performance">3) Performance</h2>
<p>Performance should be good. Being the highest performing software out there is not the end goal, but performance should be competitive with existing solutions, and ideally be in the top quarter of performers. Understanding performance is very important, and extensive benchmarks should be kept, and publicly accessible, to ensure performance is reasonable.</p>
<p>While hardware is continuously getting faster, software is getting slower more rapidly, and this is unacceptable. Good usability and correctness is more important, but the code should perform well. Where it doesn't should be understood and documented; treated like any other error.</p>
<h2 id="4-collaborative-not-competitive">4) Collaborative not Competitive</h2>
<p>Multiple options are good; no single approach can do everything well. Everybody is better served when we work together, not against each other. This way, disparate approaches still exist and still focus on and excel at what they do well, while not bringing each other down.</p>
<p>It is more important that things work correct and well. Within this, as much collaboration as possible is desired. This is why things like <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnicodeInformation/">UnicodeInformation</a> are depended on, which works extremely well, whereas the .NET Streams had to be redesigned due to several usability flaws.</p>
<p>Wherever this project has to implement its own custom components, periodic attempts will be made to find suitable replacements for those components.</p>
<p>This works the other way of course. It is a goal that this project be exposed as a series of discrete libraries, not just for build performance, but also so that other projects can depend on particular parts of this project without including the entire thing.</p>
